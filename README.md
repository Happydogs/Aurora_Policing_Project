# Aurora_Policing_Project
Analyzing a dataset of traffic stops with weather dataset in Aurora Colorado. 
This is my first project and I applied my skill by answering questions about real dataset. I explored the police project dataset and weather dataset and tried to analyze the impact of gender, age, race, and weather on violation types. I looked up and cleaned dataset, created visualizations, combined and reshaped datasets, and manipulated time series merged data. (Data collected by the "Stanford Open Policing Project" and "NOAA")
